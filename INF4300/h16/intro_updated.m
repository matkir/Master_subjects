%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXERCISE 1 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Above, we loaded the image 'football.jpg', converted it to a greyscale% image and applied a 5x5 mean filter, by using the commands:img1 = imread('football.jpg');img3 = rgb2gray(img1);figure, imshow(img3)h1 = ones(5,5) / 25;img4 = imfilter(img3,h1);imshow(img3), title('Original image');figure, imshow(img4), title('Filtered image')% The filtered image have a two pixel wide black frame.% a) Use the indexing techniques described above to remove these.% b) Use FILTER2 and CONV2 with the option 'valid' to remove these.%    Hint 1: Type convert IMG3 to DOUBLE.%    Hint 2: The image should be the second argument to FILTER2,%            not the first as it is to CONV2 and IMFILTER.% c) Use the boundary option of IMFILTER to get a same-sized image without%    the black frame.%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXERCISE 2 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Make a function that returns the same as IMHIST when the parameter is a% 8-bits greyscal image.%% Although it is allowed to use loops, try to avoid using them where% it is possible. One loop should suffice.%% Hint: How to create and use the function% A function is stored in .m files with the same name as the function.% 1. Create an m-file named 'histogram.m', e.g. using 'edit histogram.m'% 2. The first line should be 'function h = histogram(img)'% 3. Write the code to produce a histogram of IMG below the function%    declaration. The histogram should be stored in a variable named H.% 4. Save the file.% 5. From another m-file, or from the command line call HISTOGRAM(IMG)%    where IMG is a greyscale image.%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXERCISE 3 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Above, we loaded the image 'coins.png' using the command:img2 = imread('coins.png');%% a)% Use the operators >, <, >=, <= to threshold IMG2 using an arbitrary% threshold.%% b)% Image Processing Toolbox (IPT) in MATLAB have a function for computing% the 'optimal' threshold based on Otsu's algorithm.%  - Find this function using MATLAB's help system.%  - Use it to with the 'optimal' threshold.%  - Use the threshold and the function IM2BW to threshold IMG2.%% c)% Compare the binary image resulting from part a with the one from part b% by displaying the images. Do you notice any differences?% Display also the difference between the images.%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXERCISE 4 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Normalize resXY such that max(resXY(:)) = 255 and min(resXY(:)) = 0.% Threshold the result with T = 100.%% What would you do if you wanted to obtain an image containing% only the seam, and the entire seam, of the the ball?% post_id = 213; %delete this line to force new post;% permaLink = http://inf4300.olemarius.net/2015/09/02/week-1-introduction-to-matlab-this-weeks-assignment-is-a-quick-introduction-to-matlab-for-image-analysis-the-original-file-is-found-under-the-undervisningsplan-on-the-course-web-site-the-s/;
